# 🧿 Entanglement Characterization and Correction using Quantum Optics

Quantum optics project exploring key aspects of entangled photon generation and analysis.  
This work brings together experimental and simulated modules ranging from Visibility, State Tomography, Phase Matching and Quantum State Correction using Birefringent Waveplates.

> 🔬 All simulations and visualizations are implemented using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and real-world inspired dummy data.
